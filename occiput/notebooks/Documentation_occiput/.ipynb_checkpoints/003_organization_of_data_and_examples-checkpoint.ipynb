    "The mMR data can be loaded both from raw list-mode and from sinogram data. While Occiput can in principle bin the data from arbitrarily from list-mode, when loading data from list-mode we use a sinogram mashing with SPAN11 to match exactly the sinograms generated by the Siemens software. This allows us to use the sensitivity files stored in the scanner (generated dayly). Sinogram binning is described in more detail in the section [PET Reconstruction Module](004_pet_reconstruction_module.ipynb). Here it sufficies to know that in the reconstruction examples above and below, when we set the scanner type with **pet.set_scanner(Biograph_mMR)**, the software by default uses sinogram mashing with SPAN11. \n",
